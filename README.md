# Install PIRATE &nbsp; | &nbsp; Quick Start

[![Deploy with Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/piratewebsite/pirate) 

<!-- [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftwilightscapes%2Fpirate&project-name=astro-pirate-theme) -->

Setup takes about 4 minutes and <strong><i>requires a valid email address</i></strong>. This email address will be used to create an account on GitHub if you do not already have one. The GitHub account will be used to create an account on the hosting provider's site (Netlify) as well, and lastly it will be used for authentication in your web app itself. 

(Don't worry) All of this is done for you.

## Setup

- With PIRATE, there is no need to muck around in code files just to configure and setup your site.
- All set up and control is done through the built-in CMS. 
- In order to to do so online, you will need to create a free account @ [KeyStatic Cloud](https://keystatic.cloud)
- Connect your Keystatic account to your Github repo
<!-- - Copy/paste the Keystatic project settings into your Netlify Env Variables -->
- Copy and Paste the Keystatic Cloud project settings you are given into this file:     [https://github.com/YourGitAccount/YourRepo/edit/main/keystatic.config.ts](https://github.com/piratewebsite/pirate/edit/main/keystatic.config.ts)
Edit this file on line 7 - replace "yourproject/projectid" with your project settings from Keystatic Cloud.
- Redeploy your site on Netlify and then go to yoursite.netlify.app/admin to login to the CMS and configure the rest of your site.

## Using Local Development
